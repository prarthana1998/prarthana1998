<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Prarthana Kandwal</h1>
I'm a UK based Software Engineer with 2 years of work experience. I enjoy using technology to make software that can be helpful to users. </br>
Some of the techologies that I have worked with so far are Python | JavaScript | TypeScript | Next.js | FastAPI </br>
I am always open to learning new technologies.

Projects that I have worked on or are currently working on:

1) ReadTrackAPI: A backend service that helps readers track their book collection, reading progress, and notes in one place. Built with FastAPI to demonstrate production-grade API design, authentication patterns, and database management
2) MindVault: A minimal and beautiful journaling web app designed to help you capture your thoughts, feelings, and memories in an organised and meaningful way
3) Use of ML in Accelerating Drug Discovery : The primary aim of the research project is to use machine learning models to predict the pIC50 values of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
